Analytic Information in Manufacturing

    1. Odoo Gap
Out of the box, Odoo does not have the option to select or map an analytic account into a manufacturing order. 
Hence, we are looking into customizing the manufacturing application to include analytic accounts and passing 
the information on to the accounting journals.

    2. Analytic Account in MO
Introduce a new field Analytic Account in Manufacturing Order under the Miscellaneous tab.

The analytic account field will be made read-only once the manufacturing order is completed and marked as Done.

    3. Accounting Impacts
Once the MO is completed, there are 2 impacts occurring â€“ Stock Movements and Accounting Journals. 
The Analytic Account, if selected in the MO, will be populated into the accounting journals.""",
